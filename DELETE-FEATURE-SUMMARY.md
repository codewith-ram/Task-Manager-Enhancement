## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### JavaScript
```javascript
deleteTask(taskId) {
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this task?')) {
        this.tasks = this.tasks.filter(t => t.id !== taskId);
        this.saveTasks();
        this.render();
        this.showNotification('Task deleted!');
    }
}
```

### Event Handling
- Event listeners attached to each delete button
- `stopPropagation()` prevents parent element clicks
- Confirmation dialog blocks execution until user responds

### Data Persistence
- Deleted tasks removed from array
- Changes saved to LocalStorage immediately
- UI re-renders to reflect changes
